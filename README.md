# MPC 10C Labs for the Arduino Using Standard C
This repository is for the classroom using the Arduino Uno, the Standard C tool chain (avr-gcc, avrdude etc) and the Arduino Standard C Library. It includes directories for all of the lab assignments along with examples as to how to use the Arduino Standard C Library. The content is for students who desire understanding Standard C using the Arduino Uno.

Each lab contains multiple folders, each folder is a specific programming exercise. Within each folder is a program called main.c and a Makefile. The program is the template for the exercise and the Makefile is the required file using make to compile/link/load it to an UNO. 

Each lab directory also contained the Lab document as well as additional documentation recommended in the Lab.

## Status of the Labs:
1B - under review by Instructor
2B - under development
3B - under development
4B - under development
5B - under development
8B - under development

## Directories
* examples - contains code demonstrating how to use specific functions in the Library
* Labs - lab content referenced above
* Library - Arduino Standard C Library, specific Arduino functions rewritten in Standard C such as analogRead(), analogWrite(), digitalRead(), and pinMode()
