* requires a speaker to hear the melody on the pin
* connect positive speaker wire to pin
* connect negative speaker wire to ~10uF capacitor
* connect remaining lead of capacitor to GND

    // iterate over the notes of the melody:

    for (int thisNote = 0; thisNote < 8; thisNote++) {

      // note duration is pre-calculated and defined using a "d"

      //e.g. quarter note = d4, eighth note = d8, etc.

      tone(musicPin, melody[thisNote], noteDurations[thisNote]);

      // to distinguish the notes, set a minimum time between them.

      // the note's duration + 30% seems to work well:
      // a better way is to use 25% so it doesn't required multiplication
      // 25% is divide by 4 or shift right twice

      int pauseBetweenNotes = noteDurations[thisNote] + (noteDurations[thisNote] >> 2);

      delay(pauseBetweenNotes);

      // stop the tone playing:

      noTone(musicPin);
