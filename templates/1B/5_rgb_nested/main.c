/*
RGB LED Challenge
Make sure only use pins with a "~" for analogWrite()
Connect pins 3/5/6 to an 220ohm resistor to a leg of an RGB LED
Common leg of LED is connected to ground 

Modify your code for the RGB circuit to use three nested for loops to cycle
through all the possible color code variations possible (255x255x255). You may
want to skip a few, by stepping up to 255 in jumps of 16 or so. You may also
want to add a short delay at each step.
